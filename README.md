# 🐍 Python Learning Roadmap with Projects

Welcome to my hands-on Python learning journey!  
This repo follows a 12-week structured roadmap to master Python fundamentals and apply every concept through a mini-project. Each week focuses on a specific topic and includes at least one related project.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn Python by building real, concept-focused mini-projects.
- Practice writing clean, well-documented code.
- Build a GitHub portfolio of practical Python scripts.
- Track progress week by week.
